# Hi there, I'm Matt ðŸ‘‹
I'm a second year Univeristy student in London with experience using Python and PowerShell. In my past job I wrote PowerShell scripts to help save time on menial tasks. These scripts included:
- An automated report system which emailed clients a PDF file of their support hours for that month every Monday.
- An automated system to notify clients when they were close to exceeding their allowed support hours for the month.
- Email notifications for whether the nightly server backups had occurred or not.
- Email notifications if our self-service portal was down.

## Current Primary Project
[The Doghouse inhouse bot](https://github.com/Teky500/doghouse) is a team project built in Python using the discord.py API. What sets this inhouse bot apart from many of the other inhouse bots available on GitHub is its use of Buttons, Select menus, and Modals instead of emoji reactions and commands. This results in an improved user experience for people interacting with the inhouse bot. It's far easier for users to understand how to register when all they have to do is pretty a green button and enter some details on a form, instead of having to enter commands with specific parameters. Setting role preferences, viewing details of other users, and joining the inhouse queue are also intuitive.

Currently the bot is still a work in progress, with automated lobbies and other Dota 2 API features not yet implemented. However, most of the front-end functionality which is my responsibility is now working as intended. Updates are being pushed to a test build on a weekly basis. This test build is in use on two separate Discord communities, with others showing interest for when the finished product is released. Hopefully we'll be pushing version 1.0.0 out within the next few months.
