# Hi there, I'm Matt ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third year university student based in London with almost 6 years experience working in IT. I've written scripts in Powershell which were used in a live production environment and currently maintain an inhouse bot written in Python for several online communities.

Programming/Scripting Languages I've used:
- Python
- Powershell
- Java
- C#
- Netscript 1.0 (Subset of JavaScript for BitBurner)
- JavaScript
- SQL

## Current Project
[AfterClass](https://github.com/Samsquamptch/afterclass) - A webapp which allows university student to compare lesson schedules, making it easier to organise days to meet up after classes. Uses Java Spring Boot for the backend and React.js with Tailwind CSS for the frontend.

## Other Github Projects

- [GradeIt](https://github.com/Samsquamptch/GradeIt) - An Excel add-in to quickly calculate student grades. Written in Javascript using Yeoman Office.
- [Bands I've Seen](https://github.com/Samsquamptch/BandsIveSeen/) - A CRUD app written in Java to track gigs you've been to and bands you've seen. Uses Swing UI.
- [The Birdhouse inhouse bot](https://github.com/Teky500/doghouse) - A Dota 2 matchmaking bot for Discord written in Python. Currently used by two discord communities.
- [Inhouse Bot 2.0](https://github.com/Samsquamptch/inhouse-bot-2.0) - An improvement on the Birdhouse Bot which served my final year project at university.
- [Le Toucan](https://github.com/Samsquamptch/LeToucan) - A simple discord bot written in Python which posts ASCII art when a button is pressed. Configured to run on Replit.
- [Calculate Read Time](https://github.com/Samsquamptch/CalculateReadTime) - A console application written in C# for calculating disk scheduling seek times.

## Other Stuff I've Done

- Built a custom reporting script written in PowerShell which sent weekly usage reports in PDF format to over 30 clients.
- Wrote scripts in Netscript 1.0 for the game Bitburner to "hack" target servers and upgrade my own ingame servers.
- Set up cloud instances on AWS, Oracle Cloud, and Google Cloud Platform for professional, personal, and academic purposes.
- Configured an Apache HTTP reverse proxy server for a self-hosted self-service web portal used for business purposes.
- Used Figma to design User Interfaces for a proposed group project.
- Assisted in a Game Jam using Unreal Engine 5 Blueprints.
