# Hi there, I'm Matt ðŸ‘‹

I'm a second year university student based in London with almost 6 years experience working in IT. I've written scripts in Powershell which were used in a live production environment.

Programming/Scripting Languages I've used:
- Python
- Powershell
- Java
- Netscript 1.0 (Subset of JavaScript)
- SQL

## Latest Project
[Bands I've Seen](https://github.com/Samsquamptch/BandsIveSeen/) - A CRUD app written in Java to track what gigs you've been to and what bands you've seen. All gig details are stored in a SQLite database, which can then be read, edited, or deleted. Uses the Java Swing Framework for the GUI. v1.0.0 has been released, although more improvements may be added in the future.

## Other Github Projects

- [The Birdhouse inhouse bot](https://github.com/Teky500/doghouse) - A Dota 2 matchmaking bot for Discord written in Python. Currently used by two discord communities.
- [Le Toucan](https://github.com/Samsquamptch/LeToucan) - A simple discord bot written in Python which posts ASCII art when a button is pressed. Configured to run on Replit.

## Other Stuff I've Done

- Built a custom reporting script written in PowerShell which sent weekly usage reports in PDF format to over 30 clients.
- Wrote scripts in Netscript 1.0 for the game Bitburner to "hack" target servers and upgrade my own ingame servers.
- Set up instances for use in production for AWS and personal use for Oracle Cloud.
- Configured an Apache HTTP reverse proxy server for a self-hosted self-service web portal used for business purposes.
- Used Figma to design User Interfaces for a currently on hold group project.
